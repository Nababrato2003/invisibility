# ðŸ“– Invisibility Book

This project, **Invisibility Book**, implements a magical invisibility effect inspired by Harry Potter using **Python + OpenCV**.  
A **red cloak (or red object)** is detected in the webcam feed and replaced with the captured background, making it look like youâ€™ve disappeared!
This is just a bit of curiosity and a bit of vibe coding

- Smooth background blending for a natural invisibility effect.
